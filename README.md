# Applied-Statistical-Linear-Model

The goal of this course is to introduce the basic linear regression models through theoretical
results and computation studies.

## Homework

1.  Given a dataset, [CH01PR19.txt](https://github.com/oicjacky/Applied-Statistical-Linear-Model/blob/master/APLM%20hw01/CH01PR19.txt), 
determine whether a studentâ€™s GPA at the end of freshman year (Y) can be predicted from ACT score (X). See [APLM hw01](https://github.com/oicjacky/Applied-Statistical-Linear-Model/blob/master/APLM%20hw01/APLM-hw01.pdf).

2.  Some questions about Normal Q-Q plots, linear or nonlinear relationship, and diagnostics for the residuals. See [APLM hw02](https://github.com/oicjacky/Applied-Statistical-Linear-Model/blob/master/APLM%20hw02/APLM-hw02.pdf).
